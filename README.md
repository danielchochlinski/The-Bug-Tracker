The Bug Tracker app was created as a practice project to polish my react, javascript, HTML, and CSS skills. The idea behind this app is to help a business with day to day operations of the business. 

This app is a Next js app, I used MongoDB for my database and next js features for server-side code.

The app allows users to create projects, tickets can be assigned to each of the projects and comments to each ticket. 
I used some open source libraries for some data analytic tools such as pie charts. 

App also has security measures created with NextAuth.js.
